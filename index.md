## 2020, June, Eastern European Machine Learning Summer School

I'm very pleased to be attending this summer school in July (shame it
couldn't be in the flesh in Warsaw).  As part of the application /
registration process I am preparing a short video presentation to
summarise my research interest.  Coming soon.

## 2020, January, AI Group Seminars

I have taken over the organisation of the AI seminars in our
department - looking forward to hearing all about what colleagues have
been up to in their research.

## 2019, December, Literature Review Seminar

This is my first presentation as a PhD research student, given in
month 3 of the programme.  [View it
live](litreview/lrseminar.sozi.html) on a 16:9 screen, with thanks to
the amazing [Sozi Project](https://sozi.baierouge.fr/).

[Here is the accompanying script](litreview/script.pdf) for the
presentation and the [toy problem](litreview/treeproblemprintout.pdf)
given out at the start.
