## 2020, July and September, CP2020 Doctoral Programme
As part of the doctoral programme at the [CP2020 conference on
Constraint Progamming](https://cp2020.a4cp.org/), I have submitted a
short paper to describe my research so far and have taken part in
peer-review with other PhD students, going through the EasyChair
platform to submit, review, discuss.

At the conference I will give a 10-minute presentation about my
research topic.  I hope to share more details here soon.

alt="Thumbnail photo from the presentation video" align="right" /> I'm
very pleased to be attending this summer school in July (shame it
couldn't be in the flesh in Warsaw).  As part of the application /
registration process I prepared a short video presentation to
summarise my research interest.  [Watch it

## 2020, January, AI Group Seminars
I have taken over the organisation of the AI seminars in our
department - looking forward to hearing all about what colleagues have
been up to in their research.

## 2019, December, Literature Review Seminar
This is my first presentation as a PhD research student, given in
month 3 of the programme.  [View it
