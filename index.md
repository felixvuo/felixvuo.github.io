## 2020, July and September, CP2020 Doctoral Programme
<a href="https://youtu.be/ZoMjX8tGEiA"><img

alt="Thumbnail from presentation video" /></a> As part of the doctoral
programme at the [CP2020 conference on Constraint
Progamming](https://cp2020.a4cp.org/), I submitted [a short paper to
describe my research so
far](./papers/cp2020-docprog-research_summary.pdf) and took part in
peer-review with other PhD students, going through the EasyChair
platform to submit, review, discuss.

At the conference I gave a 10-minute presentation about my research
topic.  You can access the [slides
here](papers/cp2020-docprog-slides.pdf) and [watch the presentation

attending this summer school in July (shame it couldn't be in the
flesh in Warsaw).  As part of the application / registration process I
prepared a short video presentation to summarise my research interest.

## 2020, January, AI Group Seminars
I have taken over the organisation of the AI seminars in our
department - looking forward to hearing all about what colleagues have
been up to in their research.

## 2019, December, Literature Review Seminar
This is my first presentation as a PhD research student, given in
month 3 of the programme.  [View it
