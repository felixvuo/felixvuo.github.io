## 2022, August, Presenting Paper at CP2022 in Haifa
<a href="https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/186734/1/"><img
src="img/thumb-cp2022.png" align="right" /></a>I was thrilled that our paper
[Selecting SAT Encodings for Pseudo-Boolean and Linear Integer
Constraints](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/186734/1/) was accepted to CP2022.
- Experimental data including constraint models and results are available at
  https://github.com/felixvuo/cp2022-pbli-sat
- Poster presented at the Doctoral Programme to come.


## 2021, October, CP2021 Doctoral Programme and ModRef Workshop
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-SDDq-qAgeOcCRLVcO06Dw"><img
src="img/thumb-modref.png" align="right" /></a> I am presenting my work in two
guises: as part of the doctoral programme and also to the ModRef2021 workshop.
You can get the slides and (pre)recording of the talks here:

## 2021, September, Associate Fellow of the HEA
<img src="img/thumb-heacert.png" align="right"/>After completing the [York
Professional and Academic Development scheme
(YPAD)](https://www.york.ac.uk/staff/teaching/develop/ypad/) and submitting a
report of my teaching-related experience I was awarded Associate Fellowship of
the Higher Education Academy.  As part of my report I carried out a brief
investigation into using summative assessment results to inform teaching and
assessment in the next cohort.  Per-question breakdown of the marks allows some
rudimentary statistical analysis which can shed light on how questions coudl be
improved or which concepts and skills might be particularly difficult for
students.

## 2021, August, The Bookshelves Problem
<img src="img/thumb-shelvescode.png" align="right" alt="Bookshelves"/>It was
great to submit an optimisation problem to the [CSPLib](https://csplib.org) web
site.  It started with [this
tweet](https://twitter.com/FelixVuo/status/1343913107966603264) and it was fun
to connect a real-life hands-on project with some constraint programming.  The
full problem specification, and model files are
[here](https://www.csplib.org/Problems/prob085/).

## 2021, June, GTA of the Year Award
<a href="https://twitter.com/UoY_CS/status/1408441043838775301"><img
src="img/thumb-gta-award.png" align="right"/></a> I was very honoured to receive
this award after being a graduate teaching assistant, working particulary to
help year 1 students with maths (after lockdown had deprived them of months of
A-level maths), and also running some data science labs remotely.


## 2020, July and September, CP2020 Doctoral Programme
<a href="https://youtu.be/ZoMjX8tGEiA"><img src="papers/cp2020talkthumb.png"
align="right" width="144" height="80" alt="Thumbnail from presentation video"
/></a> As part of the doctoral programme at the [CP2020 conference on Constraint
Progamming](https://cp2020.a4cp.org/), I submitted [a short paper to describe my
research so far](./papers/cp2020-docprog-research_summary.pdf) and took part in
peer-review with other PhD students, going through the EasyChair platform to
submit, review, discuss.

At the conference I gave a 10-minute presentation about my research topic.  You
can access the [slides here](papers/cp2020-docprog-slides.pdf) and [watch the
presentation here](https://youtu.be/ZoMjX8tGEiA).


## 2020, June, Eastern European Machine Learning Summer School
<a href="https://youtu.be/SyihWz34KEw"><img width="144" height="87"
src="papers/eeml2020-youtube-thumb.png" alt="Thumbnail photo from the
presentation video" align="right" /></a> I'm very pleased to be attending this
summer school in July (shame it couldn't be in the flesh in Warsaw).  As part of
the application / registration process I prepared a short video presentation to
summarise my research interest.  [Watch it here](https://youtu.be/SyihWz34KEw)


## 2020, January, AI Group Seminars
I have taken over the organisation of the AI seminars in our department -
looking forward to hearing all about what colleagues have been up to in their
research.

## 2019, December, Literature Review Seminar
This is my first presentation as a PhD research student, given in month 3 of the
programme.  [View it live](litreview/lrseminar.sozi.html) on a 16:9 screen, with
thanks to the amazing [Sozi Project](https://sozi.baierouge.fr/).

[Here is the accompanying script](litreview/script.pdf) for the presentation and
the [toy problem](litreview/treeproblemprintout.pdf) given out at the start.
