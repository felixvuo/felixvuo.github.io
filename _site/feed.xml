<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/games/queens/">LinkedIn Queens</a> puzzle most mornings since they introduced
it earlier this year.  The problem requires the player to place the queens on a board according to a
very brief set of constraints (or <em>rules</em>).  For a bit of fun, I wanted to solve the puzzle
automatically (or as close as possible) using constraint programming.</p>

<p>Here’s a very rough screencast of the resulting program, which takes a screenshot of the board,
figures out the colours in order to formulate a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), then solves
it:</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How Does it Work?</h2>
<p>Let’s look at this backwards.  Once we have a particular problem definition, it’s really simple to
solve it using a constraint solver.  The problem can be defined in a constraint modelling language.</p>

<h3 id="modelling-the-problem">Modelling the Problem</h3>
<p>There are many ways to describe (or model) this problem.  The problem states that <em>n</em> queens should
be placed on an <em>n</em> by <em>n</em> board so that no two queens are in the same row, column, or are
immediately adjacent diagonally.  Here’s a constraint model written in Essence Prime:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ how big is the board?
given n : int

$ define the domain of the decision variables
letting N be domain int(1..n)

$ what is the colour of each square?
given board : matrix indexed by [N,N] of int(0..n-1)

$ in the solution queens are represented by a column id per row
find q : matrix indexed by [N] of N

$ now we define our constraints
such that

$ each queen has to be in a separate column
alldifferent(q),

$ can't be diagonally adjacent
forall r : int(1..n-1) . |q[r] - q[r+1]| &gt; 1,

$ one queen per colour
forall r1 : int(1..n-1) .
  forall r2 : int(r1+1..n) .
    board[r1,q[r1]] != board[r2,q[r2]]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The model above describes the entire class of LI Queens puzzles.  In order to solve one particular
instance, we need to supply the parameters.  Here’s an Essence Prime parameter file for the board
shown at the top of the post - each colour is represented by a different number (0-10 for 11
colours).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>letting n = 11
letting board=[
[6,  6,  6,  6,  6,  6,  5,  5,  5,  5,  5], 
[6, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10,  5, 10, 10], 
[6,  6,  6, 10,  0,  0,  0, 10,  5, 10,  3], 
[6, 10, 10, 10,  0, 10,  4, 10, 10, 10,  3], 
[2, 10,  0,  0,  0, 10,  4,  4,  3,  3,  3], 
[2, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10,  3, 10,  3], 
[2,  2,  2,  8,  8, 10,  9,  9,  9, 10,  3], 
[2, 10,  2, 10,  8, 10, 10, 10,  9, 10,  3],  
[2, 10,  2, 10,  8, 10,  7, 10,  9, 10,  1], 
[2, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10,  7, 10, 10, 10,  1], 
[2, 10,  7,  7,  7,  7,  7,  1,  1,  1,  1]
]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Solving the problem is as simple as running a constraint solver, such as Savile Row, with the model
and parameter files:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>savilerow -run-solver li-queens.eprime board.param
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We get a solution file which contains the assignment of a queen’s column for each row:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>letting q be [8, 1, 5, 7, 10, 2, 4, 9, 3, 11, 6]
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="extracting-the-problem-from-a-screenshot">Extracting the Problem from a Screenshot</h3>

<p>In order to define a game board, we essentially need to work out the dimensions of the board and the
colour of each cell.  There are many ways to try to do this (some interesting ML approaches will
exist), but I came up with the following method, given in python-ish pseudocode below, which tries
to figure out the actual colours used in the puzzle, and hence the size of the board (each queen
occupies a different colour zone, so the number of colours equals the width of the board).</p>

<p>And that’s it.  If you want the full details I have the complete code <a href="https://github.com/felixvuo/li-queens">in
github</a> - the repository has both the essence prime files and
an implementation which uses <a href="https://developers.google.com/optimization">Google’s OR-tools</a> because
the latter is easier to install into a python notebook, although the modelling is less
reader-friendly.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-post">Why this post?</h2>
<p>I believe that constraint programming and related search and optimisation techniques are an untapped
tool that many organisations are unaware of.  The big players use them all over the place, e.g. in
working out your best route on a map app, or working out compatible dependencies in a software
package manager.</p>

<p>Here’s the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Constraint programming addresses many interesting and challenging problems in
our world, including recent applications to contexts as diverse as allocating
refugee relief funds, short-term mine planning and hardware circuit
design. Users define their problems in high-level modelling languages which
include descriptive global constraints. One of the most effective ways to solve
constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) is by translating them into instances of
the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT). For some global constraints in CSPs
there exist many algorithms which encode the constraint into SAT; choosing an
appropriate SAT encoding can alter the ultimate solving time dramatically. We
investigate the problem of selecting the best SAT encoding for pseudo-Boolean
and linear integer constraints. Many machine learning techniques are explored,
applied and evaluated to aid this selection. The result is a significant
improvement in performance compared to the default choice and to the single best
choice from a training set. The approach is successful even for previously
unseen problem classes and it greatly outperforms a sophisticated general
algorithm selection and configuration tool. This work provides a thorough
empirical study and detailed analysis of each stage in the machine learning
process as applied to choosing SAT encodings. It does this in three phases:
firstly by using generic CSP instance features to select an encoding per
constraint type for each instance, then by introducing new features which focus
on the constraint types in question, and finally by learning to select encodings
for individual constraints. We find that even generic instance features can
produce good predictions, but that the specialised features introduced give more
robust performance especially when predicting for unseen problem
classes. Training to predict per constraint shows potential and leads to better
performance for some problem classes, but per-instance selection is still
competitive across the corpus of problems as a whole.</p>

good fun to submit an optimisation problem to the <a href="https://csplib.org">CSPLib</a>
web site.  This was a real-life problem (or opportunity?) to use some discarded
planks of wood to build a set of bookshelves.  The idea was to create some
bookshelves which would accommodate books of a mininum height and would maximise
the shelf space given the collection of planks I was left with.</p>

<p>It started with <a href="https://twitter.com/FelixVuo/status/1343913107966603264">this
tweet</a>.  The full
problem specification, and model files are available in the <a href="https://www.csplib.org/Problems/prob085/">CSPLib
entry</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Felix Ulrich-Oltean</name><uri>https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/felix</uri></author><category term="constraint programming" /><category term="problem solving" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was good fun to submit an optimisation problem to the CSPLib web site.
