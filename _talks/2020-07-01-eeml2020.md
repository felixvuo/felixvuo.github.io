be attending Eastern European Machine Learning summer school in July (shame it couldn't be in the
flesh in Warsaw).  As part of the application / registration process I prepared a short video
presentation to summarise my research interest.  [Watch it here](https://youtu.be/SyihWz34KEw).

More information about the speakers and programme are avilable at the [EEML2020 web
