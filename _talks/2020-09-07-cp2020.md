programme at the [CP2020 conference on Constraint Progamming](https://cp2020.a4cp.org/), I submitted
[a short paper to describe my research so far](/files/cp2020-docprog-research_summary.pdf) and took
part in peer-review with other PhD students, going through the EasyChair platform to submit, review,
discuss.

At the conference I gave a 10-minute presentation about my research topic.  You can access the
[slides here](/files/cp2020-docprog-slides.pdf) and [watch the presentation
