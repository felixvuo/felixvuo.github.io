<a href="/files/lrseminar.sozi.html" title="view the slides" target="_blank"><img
src="/images/thumb-litrev.png" style="float:right;padding:1ex;" /></a>This is my first presentation
as a PhD research student, given in month 3 of the programme.  The presentation introduced the field
of constraint programming, the idea of encoding to Boolean SAT and how some of the choices involved
in the process could be made using machine learning.

You can [view the slides live](/files/lrseminar.sozi.html), with thanks to the amazing [Sozi
Project](https://sozi.baierouge.fr/). [Here is the accompanying script](/files/lrseminar-script.pdf)
for the presentation and the [toy problem](/files/lrseminar-treeprob.pdf) given out at the start.
