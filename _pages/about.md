# About Me

I mostly work on applying machine learning to combinatorial optimisation,
usually to constraint satisfaction problems.  My PhD from the University of York
was completed on the topic of learning to select SAT encodings for linear
constraints.

I have extensive teaching experience, initially of high school maths, but now
also at university, most recently co-teaching a masters-level module in AI
Problem Solving with Search.
