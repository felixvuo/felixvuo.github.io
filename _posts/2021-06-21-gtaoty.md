<img src="/images/thumb-gta-award.png" style="float:right;padding:1ex;" />I was
very honoured to receive the "Graduate Teaching Assistant of the Year" award
after "GTA-ing" in a number of contexts, both in-person and remotely during the
pandemic.

Using my experience as a high-school maths teacher, I worked one-to-one (over
Zoom) with a few year 1 undergraduate students who had missed maths teaching due
to the pandemic, and needed a bit of help with some of the mathematical aspects
of the year 1 theory courses.  I also led some lab sessions remotely for a Data
Science module.  In these sessions I helped students reflect on their attempts
to apply various data manipulation and analysis techniques to a variety of
scenarios.
