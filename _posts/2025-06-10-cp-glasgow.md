<img src="/images/thumb-cp2025.png" style="float:right; padding:1ex;" />Glasgow,
here we come!  It was very exciting to be a co-author on two papers accepted to
CP2025 in Glasgow.  One paper presents a constraint model used by the [European
Southern Observatory](https://www.eso.org) to schedule observations on its [very
large
telescope](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/)
system.  The other paper uses the Klondike solitaire game to showcase some
modelling techniques and some CP-based algorithm scheduling approaches.

Here is the list of all [accepted
papers](https://cp2025.a4cp.org/accepted_papers.html).
