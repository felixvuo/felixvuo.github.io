<img src="/images/thumb-grad-gown.png" style="float:right;padding:1ex;" />It
was a wonderful occasion to reflect on and celebrate the PhD experience with
colleagues at a very special graduation ceremony organised by the University of
York.  Having missed my original BSc graduation back in 2000, it was great to
finally wear the gown and receive the award on stage.  I will always be grateful
to all those people who made it possible for me to enage in these years of
study, training and research.

I'm thankful to the University of York alumni organisation, "York for Life",
which organised for a clip of the moment to be freely available to graduands.
