<img src="/images/thumb-shelves.png" style="float:right;padding:1ex;" />It was
good fun to submit an optimisation problem to the [CSPLib](https://csplib.org)
web site.  This was a real-life problem (or opportunity?) to use some discarded
planks of wood to build a set of bookshelves.  The idea was to create some
bookshelves which would accommodate books of a mininum height and would maximise
the shelf space given the collection of planks I was left with.

It started with [this
tweet](https://twitter.com/FelixVuo/status/1343913107966603264).  The full
problem specification, and model files are available in the [CSPLib
entry](https://www.csplib.org/Problems/prob085/).
