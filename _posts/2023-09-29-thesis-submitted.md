Four eventful years after stepping out of school as a teacher back into
university as a student I submitted by PhD Thesis on the topic of *Learning SAT
Encodings for Constraint Satisfaction Problems*.  What a relief!  I'm looking
forward to picking up some of the research projects which were on hold while the
write-up was completed.  And of course awaiting the viva!
