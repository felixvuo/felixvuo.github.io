<img src="/images/thumb-aips.png" style="float:right; padding: 1ex;" />I'm
getting the chance to be back at the front of a class!  I've been employed as a
part-time lecturer, in order to teach part of a Masters level course on *AI:
Problem Solving with Search* here at the University of York.  I will be
co-teaching with the module leader, and it involves everything from writing
lectures, labs and quizzes to setting, marking and moderating the exams.
