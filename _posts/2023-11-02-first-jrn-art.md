<img src="/images/thumb-cons-jnl.png" style="float:right; padding: 1ex;" />Our
paper [Learning to select SAT Encodings for pseudo-Boolean and linear integer
constraints](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10601-023-09364-1) has now been published
in the Constraints journal.  This paper was an extended version of the work
presented at CP2022, with more encodings, more analysis and the first detailed
description of Savile Row's Tree SAT encoding.

The expanded results, models and code are now at
