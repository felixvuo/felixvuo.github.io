<img src="/images/thumb-heacert.png" style="float:right;padding:1ex;" />After
completing the [York Professional and Academic Development scheme
(YPAD)](https://www.york.ac.uk/staff/teaching/develop/ypad/) and submitting a
report of my teaching-related experience I was awarded Associate Fellowship of
the Higher Education Academy.  As part of my report I carried out a brief
investigation into using summative assessment results to inform teaching and
assessment in the next cohort.  Per-question breakdown of the marks allows some
rudimentary statistical analysis which can shed light on how questions could be
improved or which concepts and skills might be particularly difficult for
students.
