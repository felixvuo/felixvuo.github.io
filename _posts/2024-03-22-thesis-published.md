style="float:right; padding:1ex;" />After minor corrections, my thesis
dissertation was approved and is now live at the [White Rose E-theses
Repository](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/34581/).  This completes a very
eventful, challenging and rewarding 5 years since stepping out of my career as a
school teacher to pursue a long-held ambition to learn more and engage in
cutting edge research.  I am very grateful to my supervisors for all their help
and to my family for all their support.

Here's the abstract:
> Constraint programming addresses many interesting and challenging problems in
> our world, including recent applications to contexts as diverse as allocating
> refugee relief funds, short-term mine planning and hardware circuit
> design. Users define their problems in high-level modelling languages which
> include descriptive global constraints. One of the most effective ways to solve
> constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) is by translating them into instances of
> the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT). For some global constraints in CSPs
> there exist many algorithms which encode the constraint into SAT; choosing an
> appropriate SAT encoding can alter the ultimate solving time dramatically. We
> investigate the problem of selecting the best SAT encoding for pseudo-Boolean
> and linear integer constraints. Many machine learning techniques are explored,
> applied and evaluated to aid this selection. The result is a significant
> improvement in performance compared to the default choice and to the single best
> choice from a training set. The approach is successful even for previously
> unseen problem classes and it greatly outperforms a sophisticated general
> algorithm selection and configuration tool. This work provides a thorough
> empirical study and detailed analysis of each stage in the machine learning
> process as applied to choosing SAT encodings. It does this in three phases:
> firstly by using generic CSP instance features to select an encoding per
> constraint type for each instance, then by introducing new features which focus
> on the constraint types in question, and finally by learning to select encodings
> for individual constraints. We find that even generic instance features can
> produce good predictions, but that the specialised features introduced give more
> robust performance especially when predicting for unseen problem
> classes. Training to predict per constraint shows potential and leads to better
> performance for some problem classes, but per-instance selection is still
> competitive across the corpus of problems as a whole.
