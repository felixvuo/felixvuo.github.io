During my PhD, I was a graduate teaching assistant (GTA) in a number of courses - my work ranged
from providing support to students in person during a practical lab session, to leading zoom-based
online lab sessions during the Covid19 pandemic, to marking exams and even carrying out one-to-one
maths support sessions for students who had gaps in A-level topics due to schooling missed during
the lockdowns.
