I co-taught this module once again, covering search algorithms, game theory and
constraint programming.  I was responsible for writing and delivering half of
the material, ranging across lectures, labs, formative quizzes and final exams.

My half of the module covered:
- heuristic search, designing heuristics, meta-heuristic algorithms
- basic game theory, game trees and Monte Carlo tree search
- Boolean satisfiability and SAT solving

This time round we reformatted the assessment as a VLE-based exam, which
required careful thinking about how to structure the questions to make the most
of this facility.
