I taught maths to high-school students of ages 11-19 for 14 years (2005 to 2019).

For the last few years, I co-ordinated provision for key stage 5 (i.e. age 16+).
This meant organising the curriculum delivery, assessments, interventions, and
exam entries.  I also had to organise and support the transition from modular
exams to linear (end-of-course only) exams.

I taught across the entire spectrum of ablities and ages at high school, but
during the latter years I specialised in teaching A-level Maths and Further
Maths, including topics like advanced algebra, discrete and decision maths,
mechanics, and statistical modelling.
