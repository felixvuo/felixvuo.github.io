I co-taught this module which covered search algorithms, game theory and
constraint programming.  I was responsible for writing and delivering half of
the material, ranging across lectures, labs, formative quizzes and final exams.

My half of the module covered:
- heuristic search, designing heuristics, meta-heuristic algorithms
- basic game theory, game trees and Monte Carlo tree search
- Boolean satisfiability and SAT solving
